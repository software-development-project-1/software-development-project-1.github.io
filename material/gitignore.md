## The .gitignore file

The [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file specificies _which files Git should ignore_ in a repository. This means that adding or changing ignored files won't add the changes to the next commit while using the `git add` command. There are a few reason why we want specific files or entire folders being ignored by Git and thus not end up in the remote repository:

- The file contains _sensitive information_, such as database usernames and passwords. We don't want these to end up in our repository for everyone to see.
- The file or folder contains content _that can be generated by running a certain command_. An example of such folder is the `node_modules` folder, which contains the library dependencies for the frontend. This folder is usally quite big and we can always generate it by running `npm install`. Another such example is the `target` folder where Maven generates different files.
- The file or folder contains _IDE specific configuration_ that is only relevant for a certain developer. An example of such folder is the `.vscode` folder.

As an example, the `.gitignore` file generated by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) has for example the following lines:

```
node_modules
dist
```

The ignored files (or in this case, the ignored folders) are specified by each line in the `.gitignore` file. These two lines will ignore both the `node_modules` and `dist` folders.

> Exercise 30
>
> Make sure that your project has a `.gitignore` file which at least ignores the frontend's `node_modules` folder, the frontend's build folder (this is `dist` folder in case of a Vite project) and the backend's `target` folder. It is ok for the repository to have multiple `.gitignore` files in different folders (for example having a different `.gitignore` file for the frontend's folder).
>
> Also check that the remote GitHub repository doesn't contain any execcessive files or folders (for example the mentioned `node_modules` and `target` folders). Remove any execcessive files and folders and make necessary changes for the `.gitignore` file if needed.
