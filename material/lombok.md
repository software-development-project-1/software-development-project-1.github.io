## ⭐ Bonus: Reducing boilerplate code with Lombok

Java classes require a lot of _boilerplate code_ in the form of getters, setters and constructors. Each time we define an attribute for a class, we need to implement getter and setter methods for it and alter the constructor. [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) is library that automatically generates getters, setters and constructors from the attributes.

Before we can start using Lombok, we need to add it as dependency for our Maven project. Let's add the dependency to the `<dependencies>` list in the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.30</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Lombok also needs the IDE support. We can setup Lombok for Eclipse by following these [instructions](https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse#via-eclipse-plugin-installer).

Once we have successfully setup the Lombok library, we can start using it in our classes. Lombok generates boilerplate code for classes using a set of [annotations](https://projectlombok.org/features/). For example, the [@Getter](https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter) annotation generates getters and the [@Setter](https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter) annotation setters for the class. We also need an empty constructor for Entity classes. We can use the [@NoArgsConstructor](https://projectlombok.org/features/constructor) annotation for this.

Here's an example of using these annotations on a `Message` class:

```java
@Entity
@NoArgsConstructor
@Getter
@Setter
public class Message {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String content;

    public Message(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }
}
```

Wow, that eliminates a lot of boilerplate code! Lombok has many other useful annotations as well, such as the [@Builder](https://projectlombok.org/features/Builder) annotation. Check the [documentation](https://projectlombok.org/features/) for more.
