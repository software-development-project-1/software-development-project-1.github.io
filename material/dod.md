## Is it done? -- The Definition of Done

> "Is this task done"?

A common question among the team member's which is asked frequently for example during the Daily Scrum event. The answer depends on the team member's opinion on what "done" means. The Definition of Done is a formal description of when a backlog item is considered done. It is a checklist of quality measures, which the Scrum Team writes down together. Every team member should commit to the Definition of Done and make sure that their work fulfills the common quality measures.

> Exercise 3
>
> Read the following [article](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-definition-done) on the Definition of Done. Then, define your project's Definition of Done together and write it down in the `README.md` file under the "Definition of Done" heading. You can consider for example the following quality measures in your Definition of Done:
>
> - Should the task be deployed to the production environment? 
> - Should the task be manually tested both in development and in production environment?
> - Should the relevant documentation be updated?
> - Should other team member review the task-related code and implementation?
> - Should the user story implementation be accepted by the Product Owner?
>
> The quality measures of the Definition Done doesn't have to be too ambigious at start. Discuss as a team what are the most important quality measures for you. You can modify the Definition of Done as you go, just remember to communicate the changes with the whole team.
