# Sprint 3

For the final Sprint of the course, the Sprint 3, we have a new set of requirements from the Product Owner. On top of working on new user stories, we will be covering topics related to Git branches, authentication and testing.

## Sprint assesment

This Sprint doesn't have a Moodle submission. It is enough that everything mentioned in the exercises is pushed to the project's GitHub repository before the Sprint deadline on {{site.sprint_3_deadline}}. We will be working on the exercises for the next two weeks.

The Sprint assesment is done based on the exercises 1-17. The group can earn up to 10 points from this Sprint. This is the final Sprint of the course and the group's project points will be composed of the points from this Sprint and the two previous Sprints. That is, the maximum number of project points is 30.

During this Sprint, each group member will do a [peer review](#peer-review) in which they asses themselves and other group members. The results of the peer review will heavily impact the personal points of a group member. Each group member can earn up to 10 personal points.

> At the end of this Sprint, the group has to write the [final report](#the-final-report) together and each group member needs to do the [peer review](#peer-review). Missing final report will decrease the project points by 5 points and peer review is required for passing grade. If the peer review is done after the Sprint deadline, the personal points will decrease by 5 points.

## The final report

- Kerrataan jokaisen sprintin aikana kohdatut ongelmat (prosessiin-, projektityöskentelyyn- ja teknisiin asioihin liittyvät)
- Mikä sujui projektissa hyvin, mitä pitäisi parantaa seuraavaa kertaa varten
- Mitä asioita opitte, mitä asioita olisitte halunneet oppia, mikä tuntui turhalta
- Raportti palautetaan lisäämällä raporttiin linkki projektin GitHubin README:hen
- Raportista tulee ilmetä jokaisen projektiin osallistuneen nimi
