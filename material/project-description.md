# Project description

At week three, the Scrum Team will start working on a project in Sprint 1. Students are the Developers of the Scrum Team and the teacher is the Product Owner. Each team will be working on the same project idea, so the high level requirements for the project are the same. The project is implemented step by step during the three two week Sprints. Each Sprint will have a small set of requirements that need to implemented during the Sprint.

## Cool Reads

The Product Owner has a great project idea and is in desprate need of a talented developer team.

## Technical requirements

Although the high level requirements are the same, the team will decide on the technical implementation. The only technical limitations are the following:

- Backend must be implemented with Java using Spring Boot framework.
- Frontend must be implemented with React.

The team can decide how "frontend heavy" the technical implementation is. If there's not much frontend experience in the team the following implementation is recommended:

- Backend renders pages with Thymeleaf
- Backend handles transitions between pages
- Backend has some API endpoints that return JSON data
- Some individual features on pages are implemented with React and they use these JSON API endpoints

It is also possible to implement a full single-page application, but it requires more effort:

- Frontend renders pages with React
- Frontend handles transition between pages, for example using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).
- Backend has many API endpoints that return JSON data
