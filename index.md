# Software Development Project 1

Welcome to the Software Development Project 1 course!

During this course, we will learn how to manage the software development process and how to work as a member of a software development team. We will learn these skills in practice by developing a software development project in a software development team consisting of 4-5 students.

Each team will be developing a project described [here](/project-description). The project is a web application implemented with Java programming language using the Spring Boot framework. Also, React is used as a frontend technology. The development of the project is split into three two-week iterations called _Sprints_. Each Sprint has high-level requirements, but teams should make most of the technical decisions themselves. The project starts on week three. For more information about the course, read the [course description](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SOF005AS3AE).

The course follows a weekly [schedule](/schedule). There are weekly topics that are covered in weekly sessions on Thursdays at 14:00 - 16:45 in classroom 4012. Attendance of the weekly sessions is _mandatory_. On the first two weeks, there are exercises on each week that need to be submitted before the submission deadline. On the third week, we start working on the project in teams.

## Course related discussions in Teams

The course has a Teams team for all course related discussions. When you have trouble with an exercise or any other questions related to the course, feel free to ask about it in Teams. You can find the link for joining the Teams team on [Moodle]({{site.moodle_link}}).

## Assessment

{: .highlight }

> The first week's exercises in [Agile software development and Scrum](/agile-software-development) need to be submitted before the deadline to confirm course participation.

The assessment is based on the team's project and the personal contributions of a team member.

The project assessment is based on the following aspects:

- _Technical implementation_: required features should be implemented and they should work as intended without major bugs.
- _Project management_: project management-related documents (e.g. backlogs) should be well organized and kept up-to-date throughout the project.
- _Documentation_: required technical documents should be written and they should correctly describe the technical implementation.
- _Following the schedule_: requirements of each Sprint should be implemented before the deadline.

Each of the three Sprints is assessed based on the Sprint requirements. The team can earn up to 10 points from each Sprint which adds up to the maximum number of 30 points from the project.

Each team member's personal assessment is based on the following aspects:

- _Activity in team work_: Attendance and active presence during team meetings.
- _Technical contributions_: amount of working code written.
- _Project management and documentation contributions_.
- _Exercise submissions_: at least 70% of the _first two week's exercises_ have to be completed before their deadlines to pass the course.

The personal assessment is done based on the teacher's observations and peer reviews from the team members. Each team member can earn up to 10 points based on their personal efforts towards the project.

The final grade (1-5) is composed of the project points (maximum of 30 points) and the personal points (maximum of 10 points).
