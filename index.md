# Software Development Project 1

Welcome to the Software Development Project 1 course!

During this course we will learn how to manage the software development process and how to work as a member of a software development team. We will learn these skills in practice by developing a software development project in groups of 4-5 students.

Each group will be developing a project described [here](/project-description). The project is a web application implemented with Java programming language using the Spring Boot framework. Also, React is used as a frontend technology. The development of the project is split into three two week iterations. Each iteration has high level requirements, but groups should make most of the technical decision themselves. The project starts on week three.

Course follows a weekly [schedule](/schedule). There are weekly topics that are covered in weekly sessions on Fridays at 14:00 - 16:45 in class room 4012.

## Assesment

{: .highlight }

> First week's exercises in [Agile software development and Scrum](/agile-software-development) needs to be submitted before the deadline to confirm the course participation.

The assesment is based on the group's project and the personal contributions of the team member.

The project assesment is based on the following aspects:

- Technical implementation: required features should be implemented and they should work as intended without major bugs
- Project management: project management related documents (e.g. backlogs) should be well organized and kept up-to-date throughout the project
- Documentation: required technical documents should be written and they should correctly describe the technical implementation

Each group member's assesment is based on the following aspects:

- Activity in group work: Attendance and active presence during group meetings
- Technical contributions: amount of working code written
- Project management and documentation contributions
- Exercise submissions: at least 60% of the first three week's exercises have to be completed before their deadlines to pass the course. Completing more than 80% will have a positive impact on the assesment

The assesment is done based on teacher's observations and peer reviews from the group members.
