# Software Development Project 1

Welcome to the Software Development Project 1 course!

During this course we will learn how to manage the software development process and how to work as a member of a software development team. We will learn these skills in practice by developing a software development project in groups of 4-5 students.

Each group will be developing a project described [here](/project-description). The project is a web application implemented with Java programming language using the Spring Boot framework. Also, React is used as a frontend technology. The development of the project is split into three two week iterations. Each iteration has high level requirements, but groups should make most of the technical decision themselves. The project starts on week three.

Course follows a weekly [schedule](/schedule). There are weekly topics that are covered in weekly sessions on Fridays at 14:00 - 16:45 in class room 4012.

## Assessment

{: .highlight }

> First week's exercises in [Agile software development and Scrum](/agile-software-development) needs to be submitted before the deadline to confirm the course participation.

The assesment is based on the group's project and the personal contributions of the group member.

The project assesment is based on the following aspects:

- _Technical implementation_: required features should be implemented and they should work as intended without major bugs
- _Project management_: project management related documents (e.g. backlogs) should be well organized and kept up-to-date throughout the project
- _Documentation_: required technical documents should be written and they should correctly describe the technical implementation
- _Following the schedule_: requirements of each iteration should be implemented before the deadline

Each group member's personal assessment is based on the following aspects:

- _Activity in group work_: Attendance and active presence during group meetings
- _Technical contributions_: amount of working code written
- _Project management and documentation contributions_
- _Exercise submissions_: at least 70% of the first two week's exercises have to be completed before their deadlines to pass the course. Completing at least 90% of the first two week's exercises will have a positive impact on the assessment

Both project and personal assessment affects the final grade (1-5). assessment is done based on teacher's observations and peer reviews from the group members.
