# About the course

- So far during the studies we have mostly worked on fairly small applications _by ourselfs_.
- Different kind of problems arise while we work on more complicated applications _in a software development team_.
- These problems aren't _only technical_, the _management_ of the software development process can be quite tricky.
- During this course, we will learn how to _manage the software development process_ and how to _work as a member of a software development team_.
- We will learn these skills in practice by developing a _software development project_ in groups of 4-5 students.

# About the course

- Each group will be developing a project described on the course page.
- The project is a web application implemented with _Java_ programming language using the _Spring Boot framework_.
- _JavaScript_ and _React_ is used as a frontend technology.
- The development of the project is split into _three_ two-week iterations called _Sprints_.
- Each Sprint has high-level requirements, but groups should make most of the technical decisions themselves.
- The project starts on week three.

# Course assesment

- The assessment is based on the _group’s project_ and the _personal contributions_ of a group member.
- The project assessment is based on the following aspects:
  - Technical implementation.
  - Project management.
  - Documentation.
  - Following the schedule.
- Each of the three Sprints is assessed based on the Sprint requirements.
- The group can earn up to 10 points from each Sprint which adds up to the maximum number of 30 points from the project.

# Course assesment

- Each group member’s personal assessment is based on the following aspects:
  - Activity in group work.
  - Technical contributions.
  - Project management and documentation contributions.
  - Exercise submissions.
- The personal assessment is done based on the teacher’s observations and peer reviews from the group members.
- Each group member can earn up to 10 points based on their personal efforts towards the project.

# Course assesment

- The final grade (1-5) is composed of the project points (maximum of 30 points) and the personal points (maximum of 10 points).
- The following are necessary to pass the course:
  - At least 70% of the first two week's exercises have to be completed before their deadlines to pass the course.
  - Written peer review for each group member.
  - Passing grade from the peer reviews.

---

# Course schedule

- There's weekly sessions during which we will cover different topics.
- Attendance on weekly sessions is _mandatory_.
- During the first two weeks, we will cover topics that are important to grasp before starting to work on the project.
- The group work with the project starts on week three.
- During the group work we will learn about new topics, but most importantly we will learn how to apply our new knowledge in practice.
- Both individual exercises and project exercises have _deadlines_.
- The detailed schedule can be found on the course page.

# Agile software development

> _able to move quickly and easily_
>
> ⎯ Dictionary definition for the word _agile_

- The word _agile_ is often used in many industries to describe the way of working in organizations.
- The word is commonly used in a positive manner, for example, "we are an _agile_ organization", or "we work in a _agile_ manner".
- In _agile software development_, the development process follows values and principles that have been found to lead to successful software development projects.
- These values and principles have been constituted and written down as the _Manifesto for Agile Software Development_ by famous software development pioneers

---

# Agile software development

- One of the key value is the attitude towards _change_.
- For example, there is often need to change the software's requirements during the development process.
- Agile software development process should welcome any kind of change with open arms.
- That is, because _change is inevitable and frequent_ in many business environments.
- The Manifesto for Agile Software Development doesn't go into details on how to actually _implement_ these values in practice.
- Different Agile software development process frameworks, such as _Scrum_ and _SAFe_ describe a detailed process that follows these values.
