# About the course

- So far during the studies we have mostly worked on fairly small applications _by ourselfs_.
- Different kind of problems arise while we work on more complicated applications _in a software development team_.
- These problems aren't _only technical_, the _management_ of the software development process can be quite tricky.
- During this course, we will learn how to _manage the software development process_ and how to _work as a member of a software development team_.
- We will learn these skills in practice by developing a _software development project_ in a software development team consisting of 4-5 students.

---

# About the course

- Each team will be developing a project described on the course page.
- The project is a web application implemented with _Java_ programming language using the _Spring Boot framework_.
- _JavaScript_ and _React_ is used as a frontend technology.
- The development of the project is split into _three_ two-week iterations called _Sprints_.
- Each Sprint has high-level requirements, but teams should make most of the technical decisions themselves.
- The project starts on week three.

---

# Course assesment

- The assessment is based on the _team’s project_ and the _personal contributions_ of a team member.
- The project assessment is based on the following aspects:
  - Technical implementation.
  - Project management.
  - Documentation.
  - Following the schedule.
- Each of the three Sprints is assessed based on the Sprint requirements.
- The team can earn up to 10 points from each Sprint which adds up to the maximum number of 30 points from the project.

---

# Course assesment

- Each team member’s personal assessment is based on the following aspects:
  - Activity in team work.
  - Technical contributions.
  - Project management and documentation contributions.
  - Exercise submissions.
- The personal assessment is done based on the teacher’s observations and peer reviews from the team members.
- Each team member can earn up to 10 points based on their personal efforts towards the project.

---

# Course assesment

- The final grade (1-5) is composed of the project points (maximum of 30 points) and the personal points (maximum of 10 points).
- The following are necessary to pass the course:
  - At least 70% of the first two week's exercises have to be completed before their deadlines to pass the course.
  - Written peer review for each team member.
  - Passing grade from the peer reviews.

---

# Course schedule

- There's weekly sessions during which we will cover different topics.
- Attendance on weekly sessions is _mandatory_.
- During the first two weeks, we will cover topics that are important to grasp before starting to work on the project.
- The team work with the project starts on week three.
- During the team work we will learn about new topics, but most importantly we will learn how to apply our new knowledge in practice.
- Both individual exercises and project exercises have _deadlines_.
- The detailed schedule can be found on the course page.

# Agile software development

> _able to move quickly and easily_
>
> ⎯ Dictionary definition for the word _agile_

- The word _agile_ is often used in many industries to describe the way of working in organizations.
- The word is commonly used in a positive manner, for example, "we are an _agile_ organization", or "we work in a _agile_ manner".
- In _agile software development_, the development process follows values and principles that have been found to lead to successful software development projects.
- These values and principles have been constituted and written down as the _Manifesto for Agile Software Development_ by famous software development pioneers

---

# Agile software development

- One of the key value is the attitude towards _change_.
- For example, there is often need to change the software's requirements during the development process.
- Agile software development process should welcome any kind of change with open arms.
- That is, because _change is inevitable and frequent_ in many business environments.
- The Manifesto for Agile Software Development doesn't go into details on how to actually _implement_ these values in practice.
- Different Agile software development process frameworks, such as _Scrum_ and _SAFe_ describe a detailed process that follows these values.

---

# Software development lifecycle

- It requires _different phases_ to be completed so that an idea of what we can do with a software becomes an actual working software which provides the desired features.
- The software development process is divided into different phases:
  1. Requirements phase
  2. Design phase
  3. Implementation phase
  4. Test phase
  5. Deployment phase
  6. Maintenance phase
- The phases are commonly performed in the mentioned order and the whole process is often called the _software development lifecycle_.

---

# Requirements phase

- In the _requirements phase_, the development team collects requirements from several stakeholders such as customers, internal and external experts, and managers
- The requirements cover use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide.
- For example, "As a blog reader I want to browse list of blog posts of a blog so that I can find interesting posts to read" could be a requirement for a blog application.
- These requirements are written down as the _software requirement specification document_.

---

# Design phase

- In the _design phase_, the development team analyzes requirements and identifies the best solutions to create the software.
- For example, they may consider integrating pre-existing modules, making technology choices, and identifying development tools.
- During the design phase different kind of documentation, such as architecture diagrams, are produced to support the _implementation phase_.

---

# Implementation phase

- In the _implementation phase_, the development team codes the product.
- They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result.
- The organization of the collaboration during the implementation phase isn't simple and it requires the development team to carefully follow mutually agreed _process_.
- The development team needs to use different kind of tools to ease the collaboration, such as _version control tools_, which we will cover later.

---

# Test phase

- In the _test phase_, the development team combines automation and manual testing to check that the software works as intended.
- Test phase is usually _tightly coupled with the implementation phase_.
- This means that software developers usually implement a small coding task, write automated test cases for the task and moves on to the next task.
- Testing the software is usually consired to be the responsibility of the software developer who wrote the code, because _they are most familiar with the implementation_.
---

# Deployment and maintenance phase

- In the _deployment phase_, the implemented software is distributed to the users.
- For example, a web application is published online so that users can access it with their browsers.
- Once the software is distributed, it needs to be constantly _maintained_.
- In the _maintenance phase_, among other tasks, the development team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes.

# Software development licefycle in agile software development

![bg fit right:30%](./agile-lifecycle.png)

- Agile software development has an _iterative approach_ in the software development lifecycle. 
- In this approach, the software is developed in short, typically one or two-week-long iterations.
- Each iteration starts with the requirements phase and during the iteration design, implementation, test, deployment, and maintenance phases are completed.
- The outcome of each iteration is working software that users can actually use and give feedback
- This cycle repeats in every iteration.

---

# Benefits of the iterative approach

- The benefits of the iterative approach is the ability to _respond to change quickly_ and the _feedback loop_ it provides.
- After each iteration the requirements can change which makes it easy to respond to new user and business needs.
- After each iteration the users of the software can get their hands on new features which they can give feedback on.
- The feedback can be used to define requirements for the next iterations.
- This forms the _feedback loop_ which is the heartbeat of the agile software development process

---

# Scrum

- _Scrum_ is an iterative software development process framework that defines practical ways to carry out agile software development principles
- The offical guide to Scrum process is the _Scrum Guide_ which describes each aspect of the process in detail.
- In the Scrum process, the _Scrum Team_ developes software in fixed length iterations called _Sprints_.
- In each Sprint, there are fixed _events_, which help the Scrum Team to organize their work and keep track on the progress of the Sprint.
- During the course we will use Scrum to manage our software development process while working on the project.
