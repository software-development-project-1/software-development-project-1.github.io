- The learning objectives for this week are:
  - Knowing the purpose of version control in the software development workflow
  - Knowing the purpose of GitHub and its relationship between the git version control tool
  - Knowing how to create a git project
  - Knowing how to use the most common git commands
  - Knowing how to publish a git project in GitHub
  - Knowing how to collaborate in a git project

# Version control

- When we are working on a software in software development team, we need to be able to _share our code_ and _keep track on the changes in our code_
- _Version control_ refers to a service used for storing code
- There are two primary reasons for using it:
  - It allows us to _store backups_ of both the current and older versions of the software
  - It allows us to _share software related code_ with other developers, which makes collaboration easy
- In practice, _every_ software development project uses version control to manage the collaborative development of the project's code

# Version control

- Version control tools allow _marking a specific state of a project_ as so that one can return to it later
- If something goes wrong in the development of new features, we can return to an older and functional version of the project
- Version control stores _all the marked states_, so any team meber can follow the changes in the code, like who has done what and when
- This also makes finding bugs, or errors in the software, a lot easier

# Version control tools

- There are several different version control tools that offers the mentioned functionality
- _Git_ is among the most popular version control tools and it is used heavily in the modern software development
- Knowing the basics of Git is commonly _considered a must have skill_ for being able to work as a member of software development team
- Git has _graphical_ and _command-line_ interfaces
- The command-line interface might seem difficult to use at first, but being able to use a command-line interface is a very valuable skill in the industry
- During the course we will learn how to use the command-line interface

# GitHub

- Git provides the version control functionaly, but it doesn't provide us with a way to _store_ or _publish_ projects outside our own computer
- For this, there are several different services, such as _Gitlab_, _Bitbucket_ and _GitHub_
- The basic idea for these services is the same: they allow us to store and publish project related code into a single centralized _code base_ which all team members contribute to
- During this course we will using the _GitHub_ service to store and publish our project's code
- The software developer's GitHub account is commonly their _personal portfolio_: all their projects are there for others to see
- When applying for a job, having a GitHub account with projects is very beneficial
